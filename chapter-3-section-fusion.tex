\section{Kinect Fusion}
\label{sec:fusion}

Kinect Fusion provides 3D object scanning and model creation using a Kinect for Windows sensor. The user can paint a scene with the Kinect camera and simultaneously see, and interact with, a detailed 3D model of the scene. Kinect Fusion can be run at interactive rates on supported \glspl{gpu}, and can run at non-interactive rates on a variety of hardware. Running at non-interactive rates may allow larger volume reconstructions.
