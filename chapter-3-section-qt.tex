Why we use QT but not Microsoft Visual Studio?? 

8 of Top 10 Fortune 500 use Qt
Qt is the software development framework of choice by engineers in over 70 industries worldwide for creating, building and deploying millions of connected embedded devices and applications. They chose Qt because it’s intuitive, cross-platform and saves time. When you develop with Qt, you create more, code less and deploy everywhere — and ahead of the rest.

Qt is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software that can be run on various software and hardware platforms with little or no change in the underlying codebase, while still being a native application with native capabilities and speed. Qt is currently being developed both by The Qt Company, a company listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki Stock Exchange and the Qt Project under open-source governance, involving individual developers and firms working to advance Qt. Qt is available with both commercial and open source GPL 2.0, GPL 3.0, and LGPL 3.0 licenses.

Qt Creator provides a cross-platform, complete \gls{ide} for application developers to create applications for multiple desktop, embedded, and mobile device platforms, such as Android and iOS. It is available for Linux, macOS and Windows operating systems. For more information, see Supported Platforms.
